Codes from my 2nd Sem in college

These were the programs that I had to code in my second semester in college. Hopefully you might be able to use some code to complete last minute assignments. 

I have not used vectors or any such data structures to make these files as simple as possible. 

Happy coding. :computer: :smiley:
